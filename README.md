# Description
Python homework for Coding Temple.
Experimenting with caching inside a function scope (function encapsulation) and decorators.
## Technologies
- Python (Jupyter)
## Focus topics
- filter
- sort with key
- lambda
- map
- encapsulation
- generators
- decorators
- custom decorators
# What I learned
### Function encapsulation
> The function "hide_cache" wraps around the "fib" function, hiding the cache in its scope. It's now only accessible through "fib" function. Same can be done with a decorator.
